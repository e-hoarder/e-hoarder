# Hi there!
## Some info about me:
- I don't really know markdown so forgive me for formatting errors
- I am a jack-of-all trades (competent in none) when it comes to:
    - coding
    - networking
    - mathematics
    - electronics repair/building
- I am mostly joining github to learn git and to keep track of my 'projects' by which I mean actually finishing something for once in my life
## Goals
### Long-term
- Answering all project euler questions at some point
- Gaining basic competency in at least one programming language
### Short-term
- Making a github account
- Moving my programming attempts to github
